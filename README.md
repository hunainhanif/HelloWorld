If you are a beginner to markdown file then this article is for you. I am going to write a readme.md file so that you will have a better understanding of the markdown script.

Here I am using visual studio code IDE for writing markdown file. Below are the steps to create a markdown file in visual studio code.

Step-1: Open visual studio code and goto file > new file

Step-2: Name the file as readme.md or readme.markdown and save the file.

Step-3: Find and click the ‘open preview to the side’ icon.
Step-4: Start writing the script.

Headings
For writing headings, you have to add hash # symbol at the beginning of the line. The number of the hash symbol will increase heading type will change according to that.
You can write up to Heading 6.

Normal text
If you want to write normal text then write simple text here, no need to add any tags it will automatically convert into text.

Hyperlinks
You can add a hyperlink in a markdown file by using the below tag.

[link name](targetURL)

e.g. [Github](https://www.github.com)

You can also write link title (While hovering over the link the title will appear)

[link name](targetURL "Link title")

e.g. [Github](https://www.github.com "Github home")
note: Make sure a single space should be their between targetURL and title)

Strong and italic text
You can write strong and italic text by appending underscores _ before and ending of the line, for italic text add double star ** before and ending of the line for strong/bold text.

_Italic text here_
